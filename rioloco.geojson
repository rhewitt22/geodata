One of the main conservation practices promoted by this partnership is the conversion of the traditional sun-grown coffee into the more sustainable shade-grown coffee in the upper region of the R&iacute;o Loco Watershed. </br></br>Shade-grown coffee provides many benefits including soil protection/erosion control, carbon sequestration, natural pest control and improved pollination. The initiative has successfully restored more than 700 acres of land by planting over 23,806 native trees over 31 coffee farms. </br></br>Conservation practices include on-the-ground activities such as, forest enhancement, forest enrichment and the establishment of riparian buffers.</br></br>These practices promote 30% of shade cover to coffee plantations using four native tree species, traditionally used by coffee farmers in Puerto Rico.</br></br>The implementation of these conservation practices directly improve terrestrial and aquatic habitat that are important for federally listed species, candidate species, and migratory birds. </br></br>In addition to agroforestry practices, new techniques such as   hydroseeding and hydromulching techniques are been used to reduce pollutants and activities like capacity building to empower local women in sustainable agribusiness and other educational activities has been taking place in this region."

This project included the construction of Loco and Luchetti reservoirs to produce energy and irrigation purposes.</br></br>As result of historic land clearing and poor erosion control practices affected reservoirs functionalities, causing sedimentation deposition, creating overflow and sediments transport to rivers and coral reefs ecosystems.</br></br>Through this initiatives conservation practices has been taking place in private lands to reduce erosion and sediments transport to the reservoirs.  These practices include; runoff management, riparian forests, nutrient management, and hydroseeding and hydromulching techniques.</br></br>In addition, educational activities in and capacity building for sustainable practices to local farmers and schools are taking place along the watershed.</br></br>Addressing sedimentation transport to reservoirs provides a benefit to coastal ecosystems, providing healthy habitat for aquatic fauna, native fish and coral reefs ecosystems.</br></br>The reservoirs also provide recreational activities such as fishing, kayaking and wildlife photography."

The current land use is approximately 48% forested, 43% agriculture and 9% urban.  Poor erosion control practices have caused a decline in the water quality and in consequence a decline in near shore reef quality.</br></br>As result of this effort, a total of 1,200 linear feet of river banks in R&iacute;o Loco are stabilized through the use of bioengineering environmental friendly techniques and 2 sediment control basins and 3 irrigation ponds have been constructed on the lower watershed area to help in the management of the water resources of the area.  These practices also help with in-stream channel stabilization; reduce sediment transport to reservoirs, minimizing potential sediment impacts to coral reefs ecosystem.</br></br>In addition, studies about sediment impacts in coral reef are taking place along the coast of South West Puerto Rico."

Historically, Gu&aacute;nica Lagoon served as a sink for nutrients, sediment and other contaminants (Warne et. al., 2005).  This Lagoon also was an important area for waterfowl, migratory and resident bird&rsquo;s species.  Currently, most of the lands inside the Gu&aacute;nica Lagoon footprint are on public domain and have been scarcely used for intense agriculture, mainly because of persistent wetland conditions, frequent inundation, and challenging soil conditions for agriculture.  </br></br>The main goal of this action is to restore the historic Gu&aacute;nica Lagoon in order to restore the sediment and nutrient assimilative capacity, improve habitat for wildlife, improve water quality and to protect coral reef ecosystem. </br></br>Meetings with landowners and stake holders have been conducted to address concerns from the communities.  In addition, farm inventory and soil salinity and hydrologic study have been conducted in the Lajas Valley to provide a scientific basis for the restoration of Gu&aacute;nica lagoon."
